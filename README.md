# CLI-VN-Dialogue-File-Maker

## Overview
This CLI tool is used to write dialogue for "planned-vn-style-game" !
bills.go & billsLogic.go were created using the Go tutorial series by TheNetNinja, found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gC88BEo9czgyS72A3doDeM)
Afterwards, inspired by this, I created my own version in order to make json files of dialogue.

## Example of usage 
To launch, type into the terminal:
```bash
clear ; go run dialogue.go dialogueTypes.go
```
